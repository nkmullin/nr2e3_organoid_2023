Loss of NR2E3 disrupts rod photoreceptor cell maturation causing a fate switch late in human retinal development.
 
<b>ABSTRACT:</b></p>
While dysfunction and death of light-detecting photoreceptor cells underlie most inherited retinal
dystrophies, knowledge of the species-specific details of human rod and cone photoreceptor cell
development remains limited. Here, we generate retinal organoids using induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSC) derived from a patient with genetic photoreceptor disease due to mutations in NR2E3, an
isogenic control, and an unrelated control. Organoids were sampled using single-cell RNA sequencing
across the developmental window encompassing photoreceptor specification, emergence, and
maturation, up to 260 days of in vitro differentiation. Using single-cell transcriptomics data, we
reconstruct the rod photoreceptor developmental lineage and identify a branchpoint in development
unique to the disease state that gives rise to a divergent rod photoreceptor cell population. We show
that the rod-specific transcription factor NR2E3 is required for the proper expression of genes
involved in phototransduction, including expression of the light-sensitive protein rhodopsin, which is
absent in divergent rods. NR2E3-null rods additionally misexpress several cone-specific
phototransduction genes at both the transcript and protein level. Using joint multimodal single-cell
sequencing on late-stage retinal organoids, we further identify specific putative regulatory sites where
rod-specific factors act to steer rod and cone photoreceptor cell development. Importantly, these
findings are strikingly different than those observed in rodent models of disease. Together, these data
provide a roadmap of human photoreceptor development and leverage patient iPSCs to define the
specific roles of rod transcription factors in photoreceptor cell emergence and maturation.
